#### `lish` may someday be a lisp shell.

If you really want to try it, have sbcl around, and:

```
git clone https://github.com/nibbula/yew.git
cd yew/lish
sh ./build.sh
./lish
```

The help command may be of use.

*Note* that this depends on [yew](https://github.com/nibbula/yew) and is infrequently updated from there.
