;; It's a malformed expression, but the way that it fails doesn't make sense,

  "Expand shell braces expressions in a string. Return a list of expanded words,
which may be a list of just the STRING if no expansion was done. If DO-SEQUENCES
is true (the default), expand shell sequence expressions.

For internal purposes, we pass RECURSIVE true when we are inside a nested brace
expression, and return a second value to update how much of the string we
consumed.

Alternatives:
alt_exp : '{' brace_term ( ',' brace_term )+ '}'

E.g.:
{a,b,c}      -> a b c
x{a,b,c}y    -> xay xby xcy
{a,b{a,A},c} -> a ba bA c

Sequences:
seq_exp : '{' brace_char '..' brace_char [ '..' integer ] '}' |
          '{' integer '..' integer [ '..' integer ] '}
brace_char : [^{},]

E.g.:

x{1..5}y -> x1y x2y x3y x4y x5y
{-2..2}  -> -2 -1 0 1 2
